# My DSA Grind ðŸš€

Yo! Welcome to my personal DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) series â€” aka my coding gym where I flex my brain muscles ðŸ§ ðŸ’ª

This repo is basically my digital notebook where I dump all the problems I solve, the bugs I cry over, and the "aha!" moments I live for. Whether itâ€™s LeetCode, GFG, or some random problem I find on the internet â€” it all ends up here.

## Why tho? ðŸ¤”

- Just trying to stay consistent with problem solving âœ¨
- Prepping for internships & placements like a boss ðŸ’¼
- Getting better at thinking in code and spotting patterns ðŸ§©
